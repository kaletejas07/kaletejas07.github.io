description: Using Heroku, Git actions, and Python, automated the deployment of machine learning models, streamlining the process and ensuring efficient updates. Leveraging Heroku's cloud platform, seamlessly deployed trained ML models, while Git actions automated the deployment pipeline, triggering updates whenever changes were pushed. With Python, created web API using framework Flask, allowing easy interaction with the models through defined endpoints. This integration of Heroku, Git actions, and Python facilitated rapid deployment and enhanced accessibility, changing the way machine learning models were deployed and updated.
